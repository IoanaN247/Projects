    "## Fundamentals of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) is an [interpreted, high-level general-programming language](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/object_oriented_programming_OOP.html) that was first released in 1991. Python allows users to easily manipulate data and store values in what are known as <b>objects</b>. Everything in Python is an object and has a <b>type</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a user aims to store the integer 5 in an object named ```my_int```, this can be accomplished by writing the Python statement, ```my_int = 5```. If you're used to syntax from mathematics, this can seem confusing. In this case `my_int` is a variable, much like you might find in algebra, but the `=` sign is for _assignment_ not _equality_ (the latter is denoted with `==`). So in this case `my_int = 5` should be taken to mean something more like `Let my_int be equal to 5` rather than `my_int is equal to 5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `my_int` is an example of a _variable_ because it can change value (we could later assign a different value to it) and it is of type Integer, known in Python simply as `int`. Unlike some other programming languages, Python guesses the type of the variable from the value that we assign, so we do not need to specify the type of the variable explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python variables have a variety of data types. If you are used to using Microsoft Excel, this is similar to how Excel distinguishes between data types such as Text, Number, Currency, Date, or Scientific. Here are some common data types that you will come across in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Integers, type ```int```: ```my_int = 1```\n",
    "2. Float type ```float```: ```my_float = 25.5```\n",
    "3. Strings, type ```str```: ```my_string = 'Hello'```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the names `my_int`, `my_float` and `my_string` are arbitrary here. While it is useful to name your variables so that the names contain some information about what they are used for, this code would be functionally identical to if we had used `x`, `xrtqp2` and `my_very_long_variable_name`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see (1) <b>integers</b> and (2) <b>floats</b> store numeric data.  The difference between the two is that floats store decimal variables (fractions), whereas the integer type can only store integer variables (whole numbers). Finally, (3) is the <b>string</b> type. Strings are used to store textual data in Python (a string of one or more characters). Later in this case we will use string variables to store country names. They are often used to store identifiers such as person names, city names, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other data types available in Python; however, these are the three fundamental types that you will see across almost every Python program. Always keep in mind that **every** object in Python has a type and some of these \"types\" can be custom-defined by the user, which is one of the benefits of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest use of Python is as a calculator. We have seen how to assign values to variables, but we can also carry out computations on these variables. A Python program contains one or more lines of code, which are executed in a top-down fashion (with some exceptions that we'll come across later). The following Python program demonstrates this functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = 7\n",
    "z = x + y -1 \n",
    "print(z)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print` function simply outputs data to your screen (it has nothing to do with a computer printer, and won't waste your ink or paper!). In the code above, we start at the top and work down. This means we assign the value `5` to the variable `x`, then the value `7` to the variable `y` and finally the sum of the values `x` and `y` minus `1` to the variable `z`. Make sure that you can create this Python program and that you get the output `11` before you continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot more to Python than the above. In this case, we will introduce you to more basic Python concepts. If you prefer, you can first go through the more extensive [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) and/or the [W3School Python tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) and practice more fundamental concepts before proceeding with this case. It is highly recommended that you go through either or both of these tutorials either before or after going through this notebook to solidify and augment your understanding of Python."

As an extension of that, variables can also refer to **data structures**. These are more complicated data types that comprise many single pieces of data, organized in a specific way.\n",

    "In ```success_estimates``` below, the list contains float types. Lists are versatile and can be expanded by adding new elements to the end of the list (the right-most side is considered the end of the list).

    "To achieve this, we will use a control flow element in Python -  the [for loop](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp).  The ```for``` loop allows one to execute the same statements over and over again (i.e. looping). This saves a significant amount of time coding repetitive tasks and aids in code readability.

    "```python\n",
    "for iterator_variable in some_sequence:\n",

    "The `for` loop iterates over ```some_sequence``` and performs ```statements(s)``` at each iteration. That is, at each iteration the ```iterator_variable```  is updated to the next value in ```some_sequence```. As a concrete example, consider the loop:\n",

    "for i in [1,2,3,4]:\n",
    "    print(i*i)\n",
    "```\n",

    "Here, the `for` loop will print to the screen four times; that is it will print ```1``` on the first iteration of the loop, ```4``` on the second iteration, ```9``` on the third, and ```16``` on the fourth. Hence, the `for` loop statement will iterate over all the elements of the list ```[1,2,3,4]```, and at each iteration it updates the iterator variable ```i``` to the next value in the list ```[1,2,3,4]```. In `for` loops, it is an extremely good habit to choose an iterator variable that provides context rather than a random letter. In this case, we will use both to get you accustomed to both since you will mostly likely see both throughout the course of your data science career, but we encourage you to not use a generic name like `i` whenever possible for ease of communication.\n",

    "From the analysis, Switzerland is the country with the largest chance of success for global expansion with an estimated success rate of 0.79. The summary statistic for Switzerland was calculated with an adequate number of estimates according to company policy. Thus, it is recommended that management explore opportunities in Switzerland for luxury flight services. Jamaica is also recommended as a conservative choice. Although it did not come out top overall, none of the estimates gave it a very low probability.\n",

    "In addition, another country that should be closely monitored for luxury flight services is France, which held a 0.66 average success estimate. If there are additional resources in the future for further luxury service expansion, France may be an apt choice, but more investigation should be done to see why one estimate gave France only a 0.2 success estimate."
